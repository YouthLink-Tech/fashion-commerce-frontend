## 📂 Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns:

- `app/` — Next.js App Router pages and layouts.
  - `(withLayout)/` — Main customer‑facing pages with common layout (shop, product, checkout, etc.).
  - `(withoutLayout)/` — Pages without global layout (e.g., Google login).
  - `api/` — API routes (auth, orders, user data, uploads).
  - `actions/` — Server actions (authentication).
- `components/` — Reusable UI components organized by feature.
- `config/` — Static site & company configuration.
- `contexts/` — React Context providers (e.g., loading).
- `data/` — Static data (cities, sample policies, payment methods).
- `lib/fetcher/` — Centralized fetch utilities (`rawFetch`, `tokenizedFetch` etc.).
- `utils/` — Helper functions (auth, order calculations, date formatting etc.).
- `public/` — Static assets (SVGs, images).
